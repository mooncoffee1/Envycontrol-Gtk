U need to have RUST and GTK3 installed.

To do:

1. Make the app open in background.
2. System tray to show which GPU mode i am right now.
3. Better design and frontend for the app.
4. More dynamic information shown in the app.
5. A loading animation when gpu mode switches.


A help would be apreciated!
