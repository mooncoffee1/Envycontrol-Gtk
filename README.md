If you know GTK3 and/or rust, im glad to get some help, idk too much too.


## Features

- You can see your current GPU mode
- You can switch your GPU mode


## Installation

Install the needed dependencies with YAY

```bash
  yay -S envycontrol cargo gtk3
```

then

please create the application folder ``mkdir .local/share/applications``

after that

```
git clone https://github.com/mooncoffee1/Envycontrol-Gtk.git
cd Envycontrol-Gtk
sudo chmod +x ./install_envycontrol_gtk.sh
./install_envycontrol_gtk.sh
```
that should be all, now you can open it as an application
## Roadmap

- Make the app open in background.

- System tray to show which GPU mode i am right now.

- Better design and frontend for the app.

- More functionalities (i need to think to more)

- More dynamic information shown in the app.

-A loading animation when gpu mode switches.
